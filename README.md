# ChirProtection
All inclusive health and safety app dedicated to protecting your physical and emotional wellbeing. 

As many of us head back to school, university, work, the (unfortunate) issue of safety comes back up. Alongside it, too come the issues of personal wellbeing, and self-care. A lot of us are worried about our "quarantine bodies" being put back into society leading to an unfortunate cycle of mental stress and harm. As we head back into soceity, masked of course, we must remember how important it is to be gentle with ourselves, and I hope this app supports everyone in their personal journies.

The name "ChirProtection" comes from, as you can probably guess, the words "chirp" and "protection." Much like companies similar to "She's Birdie," I wanted to include that birds chirping element as an indication of the alert integrated with this mobile and watch app. Further, the "Chir" part of the name correlates with the large number of women and non-binary individuals who face abuse and violence without directly using the women pronoun "she/her." While "chir" is not commonly used by the non-binary community, I hope it adds an element of inclusivity that other companies lack. Further, this app is for all people, including men â€“ the name just gives women a small shout-out :)

The primary component of this project is a map loaded with 911 call data. I anticipate that in the future, more cities will be added to the map as well as a more reliable reverse geolocating software.

Feel free to clone the code, but please credit ChirProtection in all your projects!
